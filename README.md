 Redux provides a single source of truth for the application’s state, making it easier to track changes and debug issues.
 With Redux, state transitions are predictable and can be logged, which is invaluable for understanding user interactions and for automated testing.
 By centralizing the application’s state and logic, Redux helps organize code and makes it more maintainable.
 Redux works well for large applications, as it helps manage state in a scalable way.
